## How was it built?
​
This web app is built on FastAPI and depolyed on Heroku. The app uses an XGBoost model with certain optimized hyperparameters to generate a prediction.
​
## Main Features
    
    Uses the following inputs to generate a prediction:
    - Funding Goal (between 0 and 1,000,000): the amount the user wants to raise in their Kickstarter Campaign
    - Campaign Duration (between 1 and 91 Days): the umber of days the user wants their Kickstarter Campaign to be live
    - Currency Type: the currency in which the user wants their Kickstarter Campaign to be denominated
    - Country: the location of the user's Kickstarter Campaign
    - Category: the specific category for the user's Kickstarter Campaign (e.g. 3D Printing, Bacon, Textiles, Theater, Webseries, etc.)
​
    A prediction of an unsuccessful campaign invites the user to adjust their inputs to determine the optimal inputs that will allow them to run a Successful Kickstarter Campaign
